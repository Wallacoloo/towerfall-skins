Work-in-progress tool to patch in custom sprites for Towerfall Ascension.

To patch the files, just run `./main.py`.
You may first need to update the hardcoded `default_towerfall_dir` and
additionally create a `backup/` directory in the repository root.

The default replacement sprites are a Fluttershy theme, and much work is still needed
to be done to make it look semi-decent.
